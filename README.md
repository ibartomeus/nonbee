Analysis of a paper about non-bee insect pollinators. Code is not well edited for publication and I present it here as it was used during the analysis for the paper. Anyway, works for reproducing all ms figures and may be usefull for someone.

Data presented here is already z-transformed for each study system, and is also uploaded as suplementary material in the paper.

The original paper is published here: http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2015/11/24/1517092112.long
